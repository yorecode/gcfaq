    The best option at this time is hosted at
    https://www.arnoldtrembley.com/GnuCOBOL.htm

    Scroll down to **GnuCOBOL Compiler install binaries** and choose from a
    few configurations. Recommend

    - https://www.arnoldtrembley.com/GC312-BDB-rename-7z-to-exe.7z
    - https://www.arnoldtrembley.com/GC312-VBI-rename-7z-to-exe.7z

    Those builds include Indexed IO, full decimal math support, screens,
    Report Writer, more. From the soon to be GnuCOBOL 3.1-dev release.
    G-BDB is built with Berkeley DB, and includes GNU Debugger symbols.
    VBI is VB-ISAM instead of BDB, without debug symbols in the compiler.
    Visit the site for the latest, and more configuration choices.

    Rename the .7z to .exe, and click for an easy install.  Open a console,
    run ``set_env.cmd`` in the extract directory, then freely create,
    compile, and run your COBOL programs.
